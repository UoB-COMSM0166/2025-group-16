| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Map 1 ‚Äì Only players can punch**                                      | üó∫Ô∏è       | This is the most basic map, with no attacking behavior from robots or environmental hazards ‚Äî ideal for learning the core mechanics.              |
| **Map 2 ‚Äì Robots can punch players too**                                | ü§ñ       | This map introduces hostile NPCs, increasing the difficulty by forcing players to dodge both robots and opponents.                                |
| **Map 3 ‚Äì Touching the map boundaries results in instant death**        | ‚ö°       | An electrified border surrounds the arena, limiting player movement and punishing those who step outside the safe zone.                           |
| **Map 4 ‚Äì All robots follow on-screen dance commands**                  | üéµ       | Players must mimic the synchronized movements of the crowd to avoid detection, while carefully watching for suspicious actions from the opponent. |
| **Map 5 ‚Äì A countdown triggers a synchronized punch**                   | ‚è≥       | All characters must punch on the final count. Players can blend in by timing their punch correctly or wait at the edge and strike strategically.  |
| **Map 6 ‚Äì A magic circle randomly teleports players and nearby robots** | üîÑ       | Stepping into the magic circle triggers sudden teleportation, creating visual confusion and making it harder to track the real player.            |

#### Idea - Unspottable / Taiko no Tatsujin

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1243960/Unspottable/"><b>Unspottable</b></a>

Multiple players join a party game where they blend in with a crowd of robots while identifying and hunting down the other human players hidden among them, under various environmental rules.

##### Feasibility / Difficulty

- Develop an algorithm that enables robots to behave like real players.
- Convert 3D visual elements into a consistent 2D art style.
- Support simultaneous controls for multiple local players (no single-player mode).
- Ensure smooth synchronization between player actions and robot behaviors.

##### Features

- Simple controls: move, attack, run, and disturb.
- Robots that realistically mimic human behavior to blend in with NPCs.
- Multiple maps with unique mechanics and visual themes.
- Customizable score system allowing players to define win conditions.

##### Twists / Stages

- **Basic Gameplay**: 2-player mode with basic controls (‚Üë, ‚Üì, ‚Üê, ‚Üí, and hit). Robots exhibit no special behavior.
- **More Maps**: Introduce thematic maps such as Gym, Battlefield, Theater, and Nightclub, each with distinct rules.
- **More Controls**: Add actions like running and disturbing to increase gameplay complexity.
- **More Players**: Expand support for up to 4 local players.
- **Score System**: Let players set a target score to determine the match winner.
- **Online Mode**: Allow online play with matchmaking or custom room creation.
- **Facial Recognition Control**: Enable movement control via face direction for a unique and immersive experience.

  <strong>Figure 4:</strong> Simulation preview from p5.js showing early-stage interaction design.
</div>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=perKCVKo-Mc"><b>Taiko no Tatsujin</b></a>

A rhythm music game where players choose their favorite song and score points by hitting notes with perfect timing as they reach the target spots on the screen. The better the timing, the higher the score.

##### Feasibility / Difficulty

- Ensure perfect synchronization between user input, music, and visual feedback to maintain an engaging rhythm experience.
- Convert audio tracks into beat points for real-time gameplay.

##### Features

- Simple controls using only two buttons for accessible and intuitive gameplay.
- Supports multiplayer mode with score tracking and performance comparison.
- Includes a variety of songs, each with multiple difficulty levels.

##### Twists / Stages

- **Basic Gameplay**: Single-song mode playable with keyboard controls.
- **Start Screen**: Introduce a start page before the game begins.
- **Song Selection**: Allow players to select from a list of three or more songs.
- **Motion Detection**: Add a mode where gameplay is controlled via body or hand movement.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Enable a competitive two-player versus mode.
- **Custom Songs**: Let players upload their own music and auto-generate beat maps.
- **Visual Drumming Recognition**: Integrate visual recognition to detect air-drumming gestures, making gameplay more immersive and interactive.

#### Final Idea

To create an exciting and easy-to-play game, our goal is to develop Unspottable. The design of the characters and background maps will be our top priority. Additionally, we will be working on extra buttons and other visual indicators during this stage. At the same time, we will generate the first version of the p5.js code, maximizing our flexibility for future adjustments if needed.

  <p><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Stakeholder configuration</p>
</div>

#### 3.2.3 Epics and User Stories

Epics and user stories guide our development, defining major features (e.g., game maps) and specific tasks for stakeholders. These are managed on our [Jira](https://vivi2393142-0702.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/TG/boards/2/timeline) board. For details on task management and Jira access, see [3.7.2 Project Management (Kanban & Sprints)](#372-project-management-kanban--sprints) and [3.7.5 Access to Jira Board & Documents](#375-access-to-jira-board--documents).

#### 3.2.4 Reflection

Brief Reflection:
Before taking the agile development class, we primarily focused on developing our own game, aiming to create a unique, user-friendly, and entertaining party game. While we had plenty of ideas, we lacked concrete plans for developing this game. However, after the class, our objectives were broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces, which makes our development goals much clearer.

Through the introduction of stakeholders, we learned how to analyze both software users and competitors. In our project, stakeholders mainly include teachers, team members, and even fellow students in the same course, who might become potential users in the future. Identifying and defining these relationships early on allows our team to focus on the right audience and smoothly transition into the user stories and epics phase.

When working with epics, having a clear goal is essential, but understanding our users is equally crucial for building an efficient development environment. These epics can be further divided into smaller, actionable tasks based on actual requirements. For instance, in our game, one of our key epics is to create an intuitive and accessible experience for all players, regardless of whether they are first-time users or experienced ones. This epic consists of several user stories, including tailored experiences for new players, returning players, and those who prefer to skip tutorials at the beginning of the game.

Breaking down large objectives into smaller, well-defined tasks significantly streamlines the development process. Additionally, setting clear acceptance criteria ensures that our progress stays on track. If any issues arise, we can systematically analyze each step to identify where the problem occurred and make necessary adjustments.

### 3.3 Design

#### System Architecture Overview

The game is a multiplayer party game where players blend in with robots and attack each other across varied maps. Its architecture is modular, comprising pages (e.g., `WelcomePage`, `MapGamePage`), entities (e.g., `Player`, `Robot`), UI components (e.g., `Text`, `Dialog`), and a global state manager.

The `sketch.js` entry point preloads assets (images, sounds) and delegates rendering to the current page, encapsulating page-specific logic for clean development. The state manager coordinates page transitions and game progress, supporting dynamic map selection. The architecture diagram illustrates these module interactions.

```mermaid

```

  <br>
  <strong>Figure 6:</strong> Architecture Diagram
</div>

#### Class Diagram

The class diagram organizes the system into UI Components, Functional Components, Entities, and Pages. Design decisions include:

- **Abstract Base Classes**: `BasePage` standardizes page lifecycle methods for consistent rendering and event handling. `Entity` unifies `Player` and `Robot` logic for movement and collisions.
- **Singleton Pages**: Pages like `WelcomePage` and map-specific classes (e.g., `MapGame1`, `MapIntro1`), derived from `BaseMapGame` and `BaseMapIntro` for six unique maps, use singletons to optimize resources.
- **Modular Components**: Components like `Text`, `Dialog`, and `IconButton` enable reusable rendering across pages.

#### Core Design Features

- **Modular Architecture**: The design separates pages, assets (images, sounds), constants, and global states into distinct modules. New pages inherit from `BasePage`, using predefined interfaces (e.g., `setup()`, `draw()`) to add logic without affecting other components. For example, adding a new map involves creating a `MapGame` subclass, ensuring clean, component-based development.
- **Map Flexibility**: `MapSelectionPage` and `MapGame` subclasses support six maps with unique rules, derived from `BaseMapGame` and `BaseMapIntro`.
- **Player-NPC Interaction**: `Player` and `Robot` provide pre-defined API interfaces (e.g., `move()`, `hit()`), enabling easy integration of new map-specific logic.
- **Onboarding**: `TutorialPage` and `TutorialDialog` provide onboarding support, with a mandatory prompt for first-time users and a button-triggered option for returning players.

### 3.4 Implementation

#### 3.4.1 Three Technical Challenges

#### 1. Loading Too Many Assets (Images)

A game consists of many different graphical elements. Initially, when designing our JavaScript architecture, image loading posed a serious challenge. To address this, we implemented a module that allows color modifications through code, significantly reducing the number of images required. Additionally, we applied an SVG compression tool to enhance loading speed. These optimizations helped save both time and memory in the game‚Äôs development.

#### 2. Helping Users Understand the Game‚Äôs Rules

Although our game logic appears simple and intuitive, some users still struggled with getting started or using the control panel. To improve this, we redesigned the keyboard instruction panel and placed it on the welcome page, ensuring visibility for both players. Furthermore, to enhance the overall gaming experience, we introduced an interactive tutorial before entering the game. This allows players to practice controlling their characters and attacking robots in a simulated environment. Lastly, since each of our maps has unique characteristics, we now display a map preview before entering the game to familiarize players with its special features.

#### 3. Designing Diverse Maps and Rules for Players

Originally, our game featured only one map where players were the sole attackers. This limited gameplay depth, making it less engaging for extended play sessions of five to ten minutes. To enhance replayability, we introduced new maps and gameplay mechanics. Expanding on the original map, we developed additional variations incorporating new features, such as PC-controlled robots that can attack. These improvements have made the game more dynamic and enjoyable.

#### 3.4.2 Two New Difficulty Levels

Our newly designed game architecture introduces additional difficulty levels, primarily based on map variations:

#### 1. Expanded Map Boundaries

Through multiple playtests, we identified some critical player behaviors that significantly impact the game experience:

- We observed that players tend to move in a specific direction at the start of the game to identify their character.
- By introducing boundaries, this strategy will no longer be effective.
- Players will now have to navigate using all four directions to determine their identity while also being cautious not to cross the restricted areas.

#### 2. Randomized Machine Attacks

In another map, AI-controlled machines will launch random attacks, requiring players to stay alert.

- With robots actively attacking, players will no longer be able to distinguish between other players and robots by simply observing attack behavior.
- This change increases the game‚Äôs challenge and unpredictability, making gameplay more dynamic and engaging.

---

### 3.5 Evaluation

In this analysis, we apply both **qualitative** and **quantitative** evaluation methods learned in class. The collected data provide clear insights from users, guiding us as developers to improve the game.

#### 3.5.1 Qualitative Evaluation

#### 3.5.1.1 Think Aloud

#### Feedback from Testers and Corresponding Solutions(Via think aloud)

#### Issue 1: Introduction Page

- **Problem:** Unclear instructions on how to close or skip the introduction.
- **Problem:** Players did not understand how to begin the game from the homepage.
- **Solution:** We redesigned the introduction page with clearer visual guidance. Instead of static text, animated instructions now show players how to start and control the game.

#### Issue 2: In-Game Experience

- **Problem:** Players using the left-side keyboard had difficulty locating the correct attack key.
  - **Solution:** Updated control panel and remapped keys for better intuitiveness.
- **Problem:** Attack sound was too soft or not noticeable.
  - **Solution:** Audio levels and sound design are being revised.
- **Problem:** Players were unaware of the post-attack cooldown delay.
  - **Solution:** New tutorial animations now visualize the attack cooldown mechanic.
- **Problem:** Robot death animations felt insufficient, affecting immersion.
  - **Solution:** We are enhancing death animations to make robot defeats more visually impactful.

#### 3.5.1.2 Heuristic Evaluation

<em>Identified usability issues based on Nielsen‚Äôs heuristics.</em>

<div align="center">

| Heuristic Principle            | Observations                         | Score (0-4) |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| User Control and Freedom       | Exit/undo options are unclear        | 2           |
| Recognition Rather Than Recall | Some instructions unclear or missing | 2           |

</div>

#### Feedback from Testers and Corresponding Solutions

#### 1. User Control and Freedom

- **Feedback:** Players found the exit and undo options unclear, making it difficult to restart or exit the game.
- **Solution:** In our game, the option to exit mid-game is intentionally restricted to ensure fairness between both players, as allowing an early exit could disrupt competitive balance. However, an exit option is provided at the end of each game round. Users can click the on-screen buttons to quit or restart ‚Äî bottom-keyboard controls are disabled during this stage to avoid accidental activation.

#### 2. Recognition Rather Than Recall

- **Feedback:** Some instructions were unclear or missing, leading to confusion among players.
- **Solution:** We redesigned multiple versions of the game instructions to improve the onboarding experience. In addition, we created a tutorial specifically for players with no prior experience with our game.

#### 3.5.2 Quantitative Evaluation

#### Player Experience Analysis

</div>

#### Briefing

Quantitative Evaluation aims to provide user feedback through surveys conducted immediately after playing our game. Our data were collected from twelve users, each of whom played both Level I and Level II of the game.

- Level I is an easier version where players only need to attack each other.
- Level II introduces randomly attacking PC-controlled robots and adds boundaries to reduce the playing area, increasing the level of difficulty.

#### Findings

From the chart, we observe that Mental Demand and Physical Demand remain nearly the same across both levels. A slight decrease can be seen in Temporal Demand, which may suggest players became more accustomed to the game‚Äôs pacing. On the other hand, Performance and Effort scores increased, indicating that players needed to invest more energy and attention when tackling the added difficulty of Level II.

However, the most noticeable change is the increase in Frustration, suggesting that the harder gaming experience led to higher player frustration. Possible reasons include unclear map logic or the longer adaptation time required to understand the mechanics.

#### Conclusion

Overall, we aim to develop a wider variety of gaming experiences to enhance the level of challenge that players seek. Additionally, improving map introductions will be a key focus to ensure better player adaptation.

### 3.7 Process

Our team collaborated through a structured software development workflow.

#### 3.7.1 Code Collaboration & Roles

All code is hosted on GitHub, and we use Pull Requests (PRs) for every change ‚Äî direct pushes to the main branch are not allowed. This process is illustrated in our GitHub workflow diagram below.

```mermaid

</div>

- Roles

  Rather than assigning fixed roles, we adopted a flexible model in which team members could contribute across different areas based on sprint needs. These areas are categorized in Jira as follows:

  - **Design**: UI/UX for pages like WelcomePage and MapGamePage.
  - **Development**: New features, debugging, and testing (e.g., player-robot interactions).
  - **Documentation**: Updating README, manuals, and other files.
  - **Other**: Miscellaneous tasks like project setup or meeting coordination.

- Branching Strategy

  - **Main Branch**: Stable, production-ready code.
  - **Feature Branches**: Named based on Jira ticket numbers (e.g., TG-123).
  - **Commit Messages**: Follow _Conventional Commits_ format (e.g., feat: add map selection, fix: resolve keypress bug, docs: update README).
  - **Pull Requests**: Use the `pull_request_template.md` in the repo to ensure consistent PR formatting.

- Testing and Deployment
  - **Testing**: Primarily manual, with details in the README‚Äôs _Manual Testing Report_ section. We test features like player keypress handling and page transitions.
  - **Deployment**: Automated via GitHub Pages, triggered on every successful pull request merge into the `main` branch.

#### 3.7.2 Project Management (Kanban & Sprints)

We manage tasks on Jira using the Epic/User Story structure, organized in bi-weekly sprints. This process is illustrated in our Sprint Workflow Diagram below.

```mermaid

    %% Processes (Rectangles)
    Plan@{shape: lin-rect, label: "Sprint Planning (2w)" }

```

<div align="center">
  <br>
  <strong>Figure 11:</strong> Sprint Workflow Diagram
</div>

- **Weekly Meetings**: Every Thursday, we discuss progress, report issues, or raise specific concerns.
- **Sprint Review & Retrospective**: At the end of each two-week sprint, we demo features, reflect on the process, and identify improvements.
- **Sprint Planning**: Post-review, we prioritize tasks for the next sprint.

### 3.8 Conclusion

All team members agree we have built a game we genuinely love, envisioned, and are proud of.

At the start, we believed game development would be straightforward and focusing on coding would be enough. However, as the project progressed, we encountered various challenges ‚Äî not only technical issues but also difficulties in communication, collaborative decision-making, and documentation integration. Since most of us had limited experience with large-scale projects, our initial code lacked proper structure and consistent annotations. To address this, we spent time establishing a shared coding standard and assigned a member to oversee codebase integrity. This approach was inspired by Extreme Programming we learned in class ‚Äî particularly the emphasis on collective code ownership and consistent style. By applying these ideas, we improved code readability, reduced merge conflicts, and made it easier for all members to contribute across different parts. Once aligned, most technical issues were resolved. Documentation faced a similar challenge: everyone initially wrote their own sections independently. To improve coherence, we appointed a documentation manager to unify writing style and structure.

#### Team Collaboration

We followed an agile development model, holding weekly retrospectives and updating goals collaboratively. Rather than assigning rigid roles, we distributed tasks flexibly each week based on availability and project needs. Over time, we naturally focused on areas that matched our experience or interests. Some became the go-to for debugging, while others focused on design or testing. This balance of shared responsibility and individual strengths allowed us to collaborate effectively.

We used Jira to manage our workflow, breaking down features into user stories and subtasks, assigning responsibilities, and tracking progress. With each member‚Äôs dedication, we were able to respond quickly to bottlenecks and new ideas. Weekly meetings and open communication made it easy to raise issues early and reassign work when needed. As a result, we implemented new features promptly, avoided silos, and ensured nothing critical was missed.

#### Qualitative and Quantitative Evaluation

To our surprise, the most helpful parts were the team discussions and evaluations ‚Äî both qualitative and quantitative. Without regular discussions, we wouldn‚Äôt have created a game with such coherence; it might have felt like six loosely connected features.

Evaluations played a critical role. During think-aloud sessions, testers revealed blind spots none of us noticed. Their continuous feedback kept our observers busy taking notes. One clear outcome was repeated confusion around the game‚Äôs introduction. To make the game more user-friendly, we iteratively modified the intro cutscene and tutorial, so new players could intuitively understand the premise and controls. Eventually, we implemented a focused tutorial where players could practice actions like movement and punching before entering a real match. This eased the learning curve and improved early-game usability.

Quantitative evaluation results further highlighted its value once we analyzed data using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX). Results helped us identify stages where players struggled and guided refinements that improved clarity and pacing. Without evaluations, we would have designed based on assumptions. But software isn‚Äôt just for developers ‚Äî it‚Äôs for users. Evaluations helped us identify weaknesses and better understand what players want and need.

#### Technical Growth and Learning

Beyond structural improvements, we gained valuable insight into optimization and performance. Working with SVG assets taught us the importance of lightweight vector graphics and compression techniques. By optimizing SVGs and selectively applying compression, we reduced load times and improved performance ‚Äî especially on slower connections or mobile devices. We also learned good architecture can't be postponed. Early decisions around modularity, naming, and file organization had lasting consequences. As we iterated, it became clear projects scale best when foundational design principles are set early. Lessons from visual optimization to structural foresight are hard to learn from theory alone. They come from real development constraints and trade-offs, equipping us with intuition to design more maintainable, scalable software in future projects.

#### Future Possibilities

For future development, we identified three directions to enhance experience and accessibility:

- **Face detection control**: Using the front-facing camera, players could control characters through head movements, creating an immersive experience and reducing keyboard reliance.

- **External controller support**: Supporting devices like gamepads or motion controllers would offer flexible control and make it easier to play across platforms.

- **Expanded multiplayer mode**: While the current version supports two players, we plan to explore modes for more participants ‚Äî potentially with ranked roles or party mechanics. While online multiplayer isn‚Äôt confirmed, future iterations may experiment with scalable interactions.

Finally, we thank everyone who played and gave feedback. Every opinion mattered and motivated us to keep improving ‚Äî version after version.
